# I. Data infomation:¶

Data are taken from: <https://www.kaggle.com/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset>

  * "age": age of primary beneficiary
  * "sex": insurance contractor gender (female, male)
  * "bmi": Body Mass Index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height.
  * "children": Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
  * "smoker": Smoking (yes, no)
  * "region": the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
  * "charges": Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

# II. Project sumary:¶

The main target of this project is to show ways to go deep into the data
story-telling.

In this project, we will try to understand what factors influenced the charge
of patients. A summary story behind the patients in this dataset to show what
factors that feature the true patient charge will be discussed.

**c) Parameters considered in this work:**

Base on the data infomation obtained in this work. We will study following
parameters to understand what are the key parameters influenced to the
patients charge:

(i) age

(ii) bmi

(iii) smoking

(iv) sex

(v) children

(vi) region.

From these parameters, we could observe that, "age" and "bmi" data are
distributed in a range of number. We could category these 2 parameters with
some hypotheses. This will be further discussed in the next section.

**d) Libraries importing**

**e) Functions for general use**

In this project, we use some repetition operations, for the convenience of
follow-up, we decided to build some specific functions for the current
project.

In [7]:

    
    
    from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
    
    def Series_stats(var, category, prop1, prop2):
    # Step 1: State the null and alternative hypothesis and select a level of significance is 5% or 0.05
    # Step 2: Collect data and calculate the values of test statistic
      s1 = df[(df[category]==prop1)][var]
      s2 = df[(df[category]==prop2)][var]
      t, p = ttest_ind(s1,s2,equal_var = False)
    
      print("Two-sample t-test: t={}, p={}".format(round(t,5),p))
    # Step 3: Compare the probability associated with the test statistic with level of significance specified
      if ((p < 0.05) and (np.abs(t) > 1.96)):
        print("\n REJECT the Null Hypothesis and state that: \n at 5% significance level, the mean {} of {}-{} and {}-{} are not equal.".format(var, prop1, category, prop2, category))
        print("\n YES, the {} of {}-{} differ significantly from {}-{} in the current dataset.".format(var, prop1, category, prop2, category))

Function to plot Distribution charts of one parameter in function of several
variable: "smoker", "sex". The Density plot gives an intuitive understanding
of the underlying distribution of the attribute.

In [8]:

    
    
    def Plot_dis(text):
      f= plt.figure(figsize=(21,5))
      
      ax=f.add_subplot(131)
      sns.distplot(df[text],color='b',ax=ax)
      ax.set_title('Distribution of {}'.format(text))
    
      ax=f.add_subplot(132)
      sns.distplot(df[(df.smoker == 'yes')][text],color='g',ax=ax)

      ax.set_title('Distribution of {} for female'.format(text))
    

Function to plot Box charts of one parameter in function of several variable
("age", "smoker", "sex", "children", "region").

The Boxplot shows the distribution of quantitative data in a way that
facilitates comparisons between variables or across levels of parameters.

In [9]:

    
    
    def Plot_box(text):
      fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(15, 15))
      fig.suptitle('Box plot of {}'.format(text))
      sns.boxplot(ax=axes[0, 0], data=df, y=text, x='Age_category',hue='smoker')
      sns.boxplot(ax=axes[0, 1], data=df, y=text, x='Age_category',hue='sex')
      sns.boxplot(ax=axes[1, 0], data=df, y=text, x='Weight_category',hue='smoker')
      sns.boxplot(ax=axes[1, 1], data=df, y=text, x='Weight_category',hue='sex')
      sns.boxplot(ax=axes[2, 0], data=df, y=text, x='children')
      sns.boxplot(ax=axes[2, 1], data=df, y=text, x='region',hue='smoker')
    

**Function to plot scatter chart of one parameter**

In [10]:

    
    
    def Plot_scat(parameter1, parameter2,var1,var2):
      
      f= plt.figure(figsize=(15,5))
      ax=f.add_subplot(121)
      sns.scatterplot(x=parameter1,y=parameter2,hue=var1,data=df,ax=ax)
      ax.set_title('Relationship between {} and {} in function of {}'.format(parameter1,parameter2,var1))
      
      ax=f.add_subplot(122)
      sns.scatterplot(x=parameter1, y=parameter2,hue=var2,data=df,ax=ax)
      ax.set_title('Relationship between {} and {} in function of {}'.format(parameter1,parameter2,var2))
    

**Function to create a new column data (applied for age and weight
categories)**

In [11]:

    
    
    # Function used to create a new column data: applied for age and weight categories
    def Add_column(new_column_name, var, key, value):
      conditions = [(df[var] < key[0]),
        (df[var] >= key[0]) & (df[var] < key[1]),
        (df[var] >= key[1]) & (df[var] < key[2]),
        (df[var] >= key[2])]
      # create a new column and use np.select to assign values to it using our lists as arguments
      df[new_column_name] = np.select(conditions, value)
      df[new_column_name].value_counts().plot.pie(autopct="%.1f%%")
    

# **2\. Distribution and correlation analysis of variables**¶

**a) Parameters correlation (pair)**

In [12]:

    
    
    correlation = df[['age','bmi','children','charges']].corr()
    sns.heatmap(correlation,annot=True,cmap='Greens')
    plt.title('Correlation between numerical parameters')
    

Out[12]:

    
    
    Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Correlation between numerical parameters')

![](__results___files/__results___27_1.png)

  * The "charges" show a weak positive correlation with "age" or "bmi" or "children" parameters.
  * The highest correlation is that of charges - age, that's logic and as expected.

In [13]:

    
    
    sns.pairplot(df,hue='smoker')
    

Out[13]:

    
    
    <seaborn.axisgrid.PairGrid at 0x7f31b103b450>

![](__results___files/__results___29_1.png)

**b) Distribution of "charges":**

First, let's look at the distribution of charges. This will help us to know
how much patients spend on treatment on average.

In [14]:

    
    
    Plot_dis('charges')
    

![](__results___files/__results___31_0.png)

![](__results___files/__results___31_1.png)

  * Types of Distributions: _right skewed distribution_
  * Most patients are being charged around **10,000**.
  * The right-skewness of charges indicates that there are few people who are being charged higher than average.

**c) Distribution of "bmi":**

In [15]:

    
    
    Plot_dis('bmi')
    

![](__results___files/__results___34_0.png)

![](__results___files/__results___34_1.png)

  * Types of Distributions: _normally distributed._
  * BMI frequency: maximum number of patient around **bmi=30**.
  * Distribution of bmi of sex or smoker is almost same.

**d) Distribution of "age":**

In [16]:

    
    
    Plot_dis('age')
    

![](__results___files/__results___37_0.png)

![](__results___files/__results___37_1.png)

  * Type of distribution: _uniform distributed_
  * Maximum number of patients is around **20 years old**. 
  * Distribution of age of sex or smoker is almost same.
  * Special case study: age around 20 +/- 2.

# **3\. Key parameters**¶

**a) BMI and Weight category:**

The Body Mass Index (BMI) could be used to convert into other categorical
variables as suggested by [ref](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-
causes/diet-physical-activity/body-weight-and-cancer-risk/adult-bmi.html):

  * Under Weight: BMI < 18.5
  * Normal Weight: 18.5 =< BMI < 24.9
  * Overweight: 25 =< BMI < 29.9
  * Obese: BMI > 30.

In [17]:

    
    
    Bi = [18.5, 24.9, 29.9]
    val = ['Under_Weight', 'Normal_Weight', 'Overweight','Obese']
    Add_column('Weight_category','bmi', Bi, val)
    

![](__results___files/__results___41_0.png)

  * Over 81% of patients are over-weight, and 53% of patients are obese. This ratio is too high than our expectation.

**b) Age and Age category:**

According to several puplications, Patients could be categorized by age range
as following:

  * Teen: age < 18 years; 
  * Youngs: 18 <= age < 35; 
  * Aldults: 35 <= age < 55, and 
  * Elders: age >= 55.

In [18]:

    
    
    age = [18,35,55]
    val = ['Teen', 'Youngs', 'Aldults','Elders']
    Add_column('Age_category','age', age, val)

**c) Charges vs other parameters**

In [19]:

    
    
    Plot_box('charges')
    

![](__results___files/__results___46_0.png)

  * As expected, smokers pay a higher charges than non-smokers.
  * Age does have an slight effect on raising the charges, and again it is when combined with smoking that the charges get dramatically higher.
  * Charges is somehow fairly distributed between the families having 0-3 children, with some outliers of course. And it's very interesting that charges drops for families having more than 3 children. At least, there is question that larger families live healthier than those with less children?
  * Among obese-female we are seeing some "tails", this could be assumed that, obese-female might have serious diseases than obese-male.
  * The biggest effect on charges is the smoker category.

**d) BMI vs other parameters**

In [20]:

    
    
    Plot_box('bmi')
    

![](__results___files/__results___49_0.png)

  * Smoking doesn't seem to have an effect on the average bmi of gender or age of number of children or region.
  * Weight_category does have an effect on raising the bmi.

**e) Special case study: age 18 to 22**

In [21]:

    
    
    f = plt.figure(figsize=(15,5))
    ax = f.add_subplot(121)
    sns.boxplot(y='charges',x='smoker', data=df[(df.age>=18)& (df.age<=22)],ax=ax)
    ax.set_title('Box plot of charges of patients age from 18 to 22')
    ax.set_ylim([0,60000])
    
    ax = f.add_subplot(122)
    sns.boxplot(y='charges',x='smoker', data=df[(df.age>=60)& (df.age<=65)],ax=ax)
    ax.set_title('Box plot of charges of patients age from 60 to 65')
    ax.set_ylim([0,60000])
    

Out[21]:

    
    
    (0.0, 60000.0)

![](__results___files/__results___52_1.png)

  * As we can see, even at the age of 18-22, smoker-patients spend much more on treatment than non-smokers. The different ratio is such similar to that of the older group from 60-65 years old.
  * Among non-smokers we are seeing some "tails", this could be assumed that is due to other serious diseases or accidents.

# **4\. Statistics**¶

# **5\. Key factors correlation**¶

**a) Correlation of charges in function of age and smoker & sex**

  * For non-smoker patients, the charges increases with age. That makes sense. 
  * Charges of smoker patients is nealy double that of non-smoker patients at the same age range.

**b) Correlation of charges in function of age and smoker & weight**

In [36]:

    
    
    sns.lmplot(y='charges',x='age',col='Weight_category',hue='smoker', data=df)

    <seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x7f31ac19b7d0>

![](__results___files/__results___88_1.png)

  * A positive relationship between age and charges but a dramatically steeper hike for smokers in comparison to non-smokers. 
  * We can conclude that smoking significantly raises the charges, particularly for Obese patients (nearly double).

**c) Correlation of charges in function of bmi and smoker & sex**

In [37]:

    
    
    sns.jointplot(x="bmi", y="charges", data=df)

  * There is a dramatical increase in charges depending on the bmi of the smoker-patient.
  * For non-smoker patients, the correlation between bmi and charges is not clear.

**d) Correlation of charges in function of bmi and children number**

  * Perhaps a family with more children will be healthier and happier?

# **6\. Conclusions and recommendations**¶

  * For non-smoker patients, the correlation between bmi and charges is not clear
  * Key effective parameters on charges: smoking >> weight > age > sex > region. 
  * Southeast region have highest number of Obese patients
  * Charges of male is slightly higher than that of female (combined smoking & weight).
  * The are some outliers on non smokers and obese-female, this could be due to some serious disease or other specific reasons.
  * Smoking parameter has an even greater impact on the charges of obese patients, this is a very big problem for young adults today.

This project can be further expanded by collecting more data on the
relationships between the number of children in the family, region category,
some specific diseases, ... to the patient's charges. These new data will
further assist in making the overall correlation between several variables and
the charges, leading to the development of a model to precisely predict the
charges for patients.
