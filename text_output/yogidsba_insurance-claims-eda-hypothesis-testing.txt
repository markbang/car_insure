**Objective â Explore the dataset and extract insights from the data. Using
statistical evidence to**

  * Prove (or disprove) that the medical claims made by the people who smoke is greater than those who don't? 
  * Prove (or disprove) with statistical evidence that the BMI of females is different from that of males.
  * Is the proportion of smokers significantly different across different regions? 
  * Is the mean BMI of women with no children, one child, and two children the same?

# Context¶

Leveraging customer information is of paramount importance for most
businesses. In the case of an insurance company, attributes of customers like
the ones mentioned below can be crucial in making business decisions.

# Data Set¶

  * Age :- This is an integer indicating the age of the primary beneficiary (excluding those above 64 years, since they are generally covered by the government).
  * Sex :- This is the policy holder's gender, either male or female.
  * BMI :- This is the body mass index (BMI), which provides a sense of how over or under-weight a person is relative to their height. BMI is equal to weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. An ideal BMI is within the range of 18.5 to 24.9.
  * Children :- This is an integer indicating the number of children / dependents covered by the insurance plan.
  * Smoker :- This is yes or no depending on whether the insured regularly smokes tobacco.
  * Region :- This is the beneficiary's place of residence in the U.S., divided into four geographic regions - northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest.
  * Chargesâ :- Individual medical costs billed to health insurance

# Question to be answered¶

  * Are there more Male beneficary ?
  * Are there more smoker ?
  * Which region has maximum , medical cost billed to health insurance.?
  * What is age of beneficary.?
  * Do beneficary having more dependents had more medical cost billed.?
  *

**Observations**

  * Age of primary beneficary lies approximately between 20 - 65 . Average Age is aprrox. 40. Majority of customer are in range 18- 20's.
  * Bmi is normally distrubuted and Average BMI of beneficiary is 30.This BMI is outside the normal range of BMI. There are lot of outliers at upper end
  * Most of the beneficary have no childrens.
  * Charges distrubution is unimodal and is right skewed .Average cost incured to the insurance is appro. 130000 and highest charge is 63770.There are lot of outliers at upper end.

**Observations**

  * Charges incurred for males are more than charges incured for females
  * With increasing age of policy holder charges incured are going high for both male and female.
  * There some spikes for female at an approximate ages of 23,28,43.
  * Most claims are from southeast regions.
  * Males who smoke have most claims and have higher bills 
  * Number of claims made by female who dont smoke is more compared to female who smoke.

**Observation**

  * Males who smoker have incured more cost compared to nonsmokers.
  * As age increased claims increased -Smoker have higher medical claims

# Conclusion based on EDA¶

  * As expected , as the age of the beneficiary increases ,the cost to insurance increases.
  * Males who smoke have most claims and have higher bills.
  * Female who are nonsmoker also have more claims to nonsmoker males this may be because of child birth , need to explore claims type to understand better.
  * Beneficiary with 2 or 3 dependent have billed higher compared to others people who have 5.This is unusual and may be because of uneven number of observations in each group. For example, no dependents group has 574 observations whereas five dependents group only has 18.
  * Customer with bmi >30 are on higher side of obesity, have more health issues and have higher claims.
  * Females with BMI more than 45 have billed higher to insurance.
  * Age, BMI and Smoking are important attributes which can cost insurance company more.

# Statistical Analysis¶

# 1.Prove (or disprove) that the medical claims made by the people who smoke
is greater than those who don't?¶

**Step 1: Define null and alternative hypothesis**  
$\ H_0 : \mu_1 <= \mu_2 $ The average charges of smokers is less than or equal
to nonsmokers  
$\ H_a :\mu_1 > \mu_2 $ The average charges of smokers is greater than
nonsmokers  

**Step 2: Decide the significance level. If P values is less than alpha reject
the null hypothesis.**

Î± = 0.05

**Step 3: Identify the test**

Standard deviation of the population is not known ,will perform a T stat test
. The > sign in alternate hypothesis indicate test is right tailed, that is
all z values that would cause us to reject null hypothesis are in just one
tail to the right of sampling distribution curve.

**Step 4: Calculate the test-statistics and p-value**

# 2.Prove (or disprove) with statistical evidence that the BMI of females is

# 3.Is the proportion of smokers significantly different across different

not significantly different across different regions * Ha Smokers proportions
is different across different regions
