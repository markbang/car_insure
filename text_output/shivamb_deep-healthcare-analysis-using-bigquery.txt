# An Extensive Medicare Data Exploration - Healthcare Analysis¶

## About Medicare¶

In the United States, Medicare is a single-payer, national social insurance
program administered by the U.S. federal government since 1966. United States
Medicare is funded by a payroll tax, premiums and surtaxes from beneficiaries,
and general revenue. It provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and
older who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax. It
also provides health insurance to younger people with some disability status
as determined by the Social Security Administration, as well as people with
end stage renal disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

In 2015, Medicare provided health insurance for over **55 million** (46
million people age 65 and older and 9 million younger people). On average,
Medicare covers about half of the health care charges for those enrolled. The
enrollees must then cover their remaining costs either with supplemental
insurance, separate insurance, or out-of-pocket. Out-of-pocket costs can vary
depending on the amount of health care a Medicare enrollee needs.

## About CMS¶

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), previously known as the
Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), is a federal agency within the
United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers
the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to
administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and
health insurance portability standards. In addition to these programs, CMS has
other responsibilities, including the administrative simplification standards
from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA),
quality standards in long-term care facilities (more commonly referred to as
nursing homes) through its survey and certification process, clinical
laboratory quality standards under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments, and oversight of HealthCare.gov.

## About the Data-Set¶

This [public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/cms/cms-medicare) was created by
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The data summarizes the
utilization and payments for procedures, services, and prescription drugs
provided to Medicare beneficiaries by specific inpatient and outpatient
hospitals, physicians, and other suppliers. The dataset includes the following
data: Common inpatient and outpatient services, All physician and other
supplier procedures and services, All Part D prescriptions. Providers
determine what they will charge for items, services, and procedures provided
to patients and these charges are the amount that providers bill for an item,
service, or procedure.

In this notebook, I have explored the complete dataset using BigQuery,
performed clustering on nursing facilities data to identify groups of nursing
facilities having similar characteristics

## 1\. Which State has the highest (and lowest) number of Nursing Facilities¶

Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and nursing facilities (NFs) are provided by
CMS under medicare. Different States of US have differnt number of nursing
facilities. Number of nursing facilities in a state might be an indicator of
how good is the quality of care in different states. Lets obtain the number if
of nursing facilities using 2014 dataset

## 2\. Which State (and Nursing Facilities) have poor HCC risk adjustment
scores¶

The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses a Hierarchical
Condition Category (HCC) risk adjustment model to calculate risk scores. The
HCC model ranks diagnoses into categories that represent conditions with
similar cost patterns. Higher categories represent higher predicted healthcare
costs, resulting in higher risk scores. CMS uses HCCs to reimburse Medicare
Advantage plans based on the health of their members. It pays accurately for
the predicted cost expenditures of patients by adjusting those payments based
on demographic information and patient health status. The risk assessment data
used is based on the diagnosis information pulled from claims and medical
records which are collected by physician offices, hospital inpatient visits
and in outpatient settings.

CMS states that higher HCC scores means there is higher risk of chronic
diseases while lower hcc indicates healthy population. It will be interesting
to see what is the average hcc score for different states and facilities.

### 2.1 Max and Min HCCs for different states¶

## 6\. Clustering Nursing Facilities having similar behaviours¶

In this section, we will try to cluster the nursing facilities based on the 29
key features about them. I have choosen following features based on the amount
of missing values and healthcare domain importance.

**features_used_for_clustering** = [ 'total_stays',
'distinct_beneficiaries_per_provider', 'average_length_of_stays_days',
'total_snf_charge_amount', 'total_snf_medicare_allowed_amount',
'total_snf_medicare_payment_amount',
'total_snf_medicare_standard_payment_amount', 'average_age',
'male_beneficiaries', 'female_beneficiaries', 'nondual_beneficiaries',
'dual_beneficiaries', 'white_beneficiaries', 'black_beneficiaries' ,
'average_hcc_score', 'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_atrial_fibrillation',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_asthma',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_cancer', 'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_chf',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_chronic_kidney_disease',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_copd',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_depression',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_diabetes',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_hyperlipidemia',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_ihd',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_osteoporosis',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_ra_oa',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_schizophrenia',
'percent_of_beneficiaries_with_stroke']

### 6.1 K-Means Clustering¶

By hit-and-trial and running elbow method iteratively, I have choosen the
number of clusters to be equal to 3. ie. every nursing facility will be
classified to one of the three clusters. This will help to identify the
Nursing Facilities having similar behaviours / characteristics. Before Running
Clustering I have applied data Preprocessing which includes Removing textual
columns and dropping the missing Values

#### Distinct Beneficiaries Per Provider¶

### 6.5 Inference about Different Groups¶

**Characteristics of Nursing Facilities in Group A**

>   * This group contains one of the best performing nursing facilities having
> low HCC risk scores, medicare payments etc than other groups.
>   * This group consists of nursing facilities having the HCC score is the
> LOWEST (mean = 2.25), which indicates that these Nursing Facilities might
> have performed / served better to maintain a healthy population
>   * Average value of Total Skilled Nursing Facility Charge in this group is
> also lowest (about 1.54 Million), Medicare Payment's average value is equal
> to 962K with the mean value of distinct beneficiaries equal to 79. All of
> these values are lowest when compared to values for Nursing Facilities in
> Group B, C, and D.
>   * The White Beneficiary distribution of this group is scattered over to
> lower side with the mean of the normal curve equal to about 50. While the
> Black beneficiary distribution of this group contains very less data. Does
> this indicate that the nursing facilities in this group (almost) always
> serve to White Population? Maybe Yes !
>   * Similar distribution behaviour is shown by the variables - total stays
> and distinct beneficiaries per providers
>

**Characteristics of Nursing Facilities in Group B**

>   * Group B is one of those group in which the HCC risk value is on the
> higher side (average = 2.40)
>   * The White population beneficiaries of this group are scattered normally
> pivoted at 220-239 while black population beneficiaries is much higher than
> group A but it still on the lower side
>

**Characteristics of Nursing Facilities in Group C**

>   * Group C is the one in which mean HCC value is not that higher but mean
> value of Total Skilled Nursing Facility Charge (9.1 M), Medicare Payment
> (16.1 M), and the number of distinct beneficiaries (580) is the highest
> among any other groups.
>   * There is less variability in the number of black beneficiaries and it
> follows a pretty standard set of values
>

**Characteristics of Nursing Facilities in Group D**

>   * In Group D, the average HCC score of Nursing Facilities is the highest
> than any other group equal to 2.45
>
