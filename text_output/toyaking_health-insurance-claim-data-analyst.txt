# Introduction¶

According to [History.com](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-
history/surgeon-general-announces-link-between-smoking-cigarettes-and-cancer),
on January 11, 1964 the U.S. Surgeon General publicized a direct link between
smoking cigarettes and cancer. Since that announcement people opting to smoke
were aware of the risks. However, other lifestyle illnesses can result from
the diets that are ingrained in culture and geographical regions. Diabetes,
obesity and high blood pressure were once deemed ailments that primarily
afflicted the elderly population. However, due to exorbitant diets and
seditary lifestyles it is possible for younger generations to experience these
debilitating conditions. This study will examine patient age, gender, BMI
(Body Mass Index), blood pressure levels, diabetic status, number of children,
smoking status and region in relation to health insurance claim costs. This
analysis will seek to determine people who will need to obtain medical
services leading to medical claims.

# About the Data¶

The dataset provides a plethora of information needed to assess health
insurance claims. Factors including age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood
pressure, diabetic status, number of children, region, smoking status and
claim amounts are contained in the data.

The data set was sourced by [The
Devastator](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator)

The dataset was created by [Sumit Kumar Shukla](https://data.world/sumitrock)

According to the
[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html#InterpretedAdults),
BMI that is between 18.5 to 24.9 indicates a healthy weight for men and women
20 years old or older. BMI between 25.0 and 29.9 indicates overweight and 30
and above is classified as obese. Below 18.5 is classified as underweight

The majority of patients receiving health insurance claims are obese. The cost
of the claims for patients with BMI 30 and above ranges broadly from less than
10,000 to above 60,000.

the following list of years are ascribed to generational age groups: Gen Z
1995 - 2010, Millennials 1977-1995, Gen X 1965-1976 and Baby Boomers
1946-1964.

[Heart.org](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-
pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings) lists the systolic mm Hg,
(upper number) blood pressure ranges less than 120 as normal, 120-129
elevated, 130 -139 High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) Stage 1, 140 or higher
High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) Stage 2, higher than 180 Hypertensive
crisis. The data set did not include any patients that experienced a
hypertensive crisis.

There are significantly more obese patients that are millennials than any
other age group. The majority of millennials have normal blood pressure
ranges. However, millennials have more elevated blood pressure and
hypertension stage 1 blood pressure ranges than any other age group.

Patients in the Southeast and Northeast have the highest blood pressure.
However, blood pressure less than 120 is classified as normal.

# Problems¶

Patients in the Southeast have significantly more claims than any other
region. The vast majority of these claims are among millennials. Obesity is a
prevalent factor among claim recipients. This is of great concern due to
millennials being parents to the majority of children currently under 18 years
old. If this pattern continues future generations will be prone to obesity
which will lead to perpetual illness and excessive medical costs.

# Solutions¶

According to the
[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/nutrition/school_nutrition_education.htm),
40 to 50 hours of nutritional education per year are needed to positively
affect behavior change. Currently U.S. students receive less than 8 hours of
nutritional education each year. School administrators and teachers have the
ability to literally shape the future. Opportunities to teach healthy
lifestyles are abundant in all grades. Teaching math by counting fruits and
vegetables, planting school gardens and introducing tasty healthy food options
in the cafeteria are just a few ways that children can be taught to eat to
live instead of living to eat.

# Next Steps¶

State and local government officials should coordinate with school
administrators to ensure schools have the needed resources to teach healthy
eating habits. Teachers should enlist the help of their students when creating
lessons that center on healthy lifestyles. Additionally, some activities and
events can be structured to include the entire family. These actions will put
millennials and their children on track to better health outcomes.
