# Problem Statement¶

Understanding the relation between the various factor like bmi, number of
children or smoker affecting the Hosiptalization charges. Predicting the
hospitalization by understanding patterns from other parameters.

# Understanding the data¶

  * ****age**** : age of primary beneficiary
  * ****sex**** : insurance contractor gender, female, male
  * ****bmi**** : Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
  * ****children**** : Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
  * ****smoker**** : Smoking
  * ****region**** : the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
  * ****charges**** : Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

        else: 
            print('Fail to Reject NULL HYPOTHESIS') 
    

## Question 1 -¶

To prove charges of people who do smoking are greater than those who don't.

### Performing Right Tailed T-test¶

Null Hypothesis ( H0 ) - Charges are same for Smokers and Non-Smokers

Alternate Hypothesis ( HA ) - Charges are greater for smokers.

#### First Step -¶

Checking for basic assumpitons for the hypothesis

#### Second step-¶

Performing Right tailed t-test

#### Third step -¶

Checking for hypothesis result

## Checking for basic assumptions¶

  * Normality check
  * Homogeneity of Variances

### For normality check, using Q-Q Plot¶

In [40]:

    
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    stats.probplot(data['charges'], plot= plt, dist="norm")
    plt.title('Q-Q plot for charges')
    plt.show()
    

![](__results___files/__results___79_0.png)

****From the above graph we can say, the data points roughly fall along a
straight diagonal line in a Q-Q plot, then the dataset likely follows a normal
distribution.****

### Homogeneity of Variances using Lavene's test¶

Null Hypothesis(H0) - Homogenous Variance

Alternate Hypothesis(HA) - Non Homogenous variance

In [41]:

    
    
    smokers = data[data['smoker']=='yes']['charges']
    non_smokers = data[data['smoker']=='no']['charges']
    stat,p = levene(smokers,non_smokers)
    

In [42]:

    
    
    print('P-value :',p)
    
    
    
    P-value : 1.5030077909802603e-20
    

In [43]:

    
    
    htResult(p)
    
    
    
    Reject NULL HYPOTHESIS
    

****We reject null hypothesis, which means variance is not equal.****

## Performing Right tailed t-test¶

In [44]:

    
    
    st,p = stats.ttest_ind(smokers,non_smokers)
    print('P-value :',(p/2))
    
    
    
    P-value : 9.15281412995057e-170
    

In [45]:

    
    
    htResult(p/2)
    
    
    
    Reject NULL HYPOTHESIS
    

## Answer¶

****We reject null hypothesis, which means the hospitalization charge for
smokers is more than non-smoker.****

## Question 2 -¶

To prove the BMI of females is different from that of males .

### Performing Two Tailed T-test¶

Null Hypothesis ( H0 ) - BMI for male and females are same.

Alternate Hypothesis ( HA ) - BMI for males and females are different.

#### First Step -¶

Checking for basic assumpitons for the hypothesis

#### Second step-¶

Performing Two tailed t-test

#### Third step -¶

Checking for hypothesis result

## Checking for basic assumptions¶

  * Normality check
  * Homogeneity of Variances

### For normality check, using Q-Q Plot¶

In [46]:

    
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    stats.probplot(data['bmi'], plot= plt, dist="norm")
    plt.title('Q-Q plot for BMI')
    plt.show()
    

![](__results___files/__results___93_0.png)

****From the above graph we can say, the data points roughly fall along a
straight diagonal line in a Q-Q plot, then the dataset likely follows a normal
distribution.****

### Homogeneity of Variances using Levene's test¶

Null Hypothesis(H0) - Homogenous Variance

Alternate Hypothesis(HA) - Non Homogenous variance

In [47]:

    
    
    males = data[data['sex']=='male']['bmi']
    females = data[data['sex']=='female']['bmi']
    stat,p = levene(males,females)
    

In [48]:

    
    
    print('P-value :',p)
    
    
    
    P-value : 0.7548571190984414
    

In [49]:

    
    
    htResult(p)
    
    
    
    Fail to Reject NULL HYPOTHESIS
    

****We fail to reject null hypothesis, which means the variance is same.****

## Performing two tailed t-test¶

In [50]:

    
    
    st,p = stats.ttest_ind(males,females)
    print('P-value :',p)
    
    
    
    P-value : 0.14542176311155552
    

In [51]:

    
    
    htResult(p)
    
    
    
    Fail to Reject NULL HYPOTHESIS
    

## Answer¶

****We fail to reject null hypothesis, which means the bmi for females is not
different from males.****

## Question 3 -¶

To check if the proportion of smoking significantly different across different
regions.

### Performing Chi-Square test¶

Null Hypothesis ( H0 ) - Proportion of smoking is equal across different
regions.

Alternate Hypothesis ( HA ) - Proportion of smoking is different across
different regions.

#### First step-¶

Performing chi-square test

#### Second step -¶

Checking for hypothesis result

In [52]:

    
    
    cont = pd.crosstab(data['smoker'],data['region'])
    value = np.array([cont.iloc[0][0:4].values,cont.iloc[1][0:4].values])
    

### Performing chi-square test¶

In [53]:

    
    
    c, p, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(value)
    print('P-value :',p)
    
    
    
    P-value : 0.05978076201764091
    

In [54]:

    
    
    htResult(p)
    
    
    
    Fail to Reject NULL HYPOTHESIS
    

## Answer¶

****We fail to reject null hypothesis, which means the proportion of smoking
is same across different regions.****

## Question 4 -¶

To check if the mean BMI of women with 0 child , 1 child, and 2 children the
same.

### Performing One-way Anova¶

Null Hypothesis ( H0 ) - Mean BMI for females of children 0,1,2 is same.

Alternate Hypothesis ( HA ) - Mean BMI for females of children 0,1,2 is
different.

#### First Step -¶

Checking for basic assumpitons for the hypothesis

#### Second step-¶

Performing One-way Anova

#### Third step -¶

Checking for hypothesis result

## Checking for basic assumptions¶

  * Normality check
  * Homogeneity of Variances

****Normality check for viral load is done and found out to be normal.****

### Homogeneity of Variances with Levene's test¶

Null Hypothesis(H0) - Homogenous Variance

Alternate Hypothesis(HA) - Non Homogenous variance

In [55]:

    
    
    female = data[data['sex']=='female']
    fem_ch_0 = female[female['children']==0]['bmi']
    fem_ch_1 = female[female['children']==1]['bmi']
    fem_ch_2 = female[female['children']==2]['bmi']
    fem_ch_3 = female[female['children']==3]['bmi']
    fem_ch_4 = female[female['children']==4]['bmi']
    fem_ch_5 = female[female['children']==5]['bmi']
    

In [56]:

    
    
    stat,p = levene(fem_ch_0,fem_ch_1,fem_ch_2,fem_ch_3,fem_ch_4,fem_ch_5)
    print('P-value :',p)
    
    
    
    P-value : 0.4427290219991681
    

In [57]:

    
    
    htResult(p)
    
    
    
    Fail to Reject NULL HYPOTHESIS
    

****We fail to reject null hypothesis, which means the variance is same across
the groups.****

## Performing One-Way Anova¶

In [58]:

    
    
    stat,p = stats.f_oneway(fem_ch_0,fem_ch_1,fem_ch_2,fem_ch_3,fem_ch_4,fem_ch_5)
    print('P-value :',p)
    
    
    
    P-value : 0.9465287059938946
    

In [59]:

    
    
    htResult(p)
    
    
    
    Fail to Reject NULL HYPOTHESIS
    

## Answer¶

****We fail to reject null hypothesis, which means the mean viral load for
females of severity levels 0,1,2 is same.****

# Recommendations -¶

  * As we can observe the smokers in general have a higher charges so we can create awareness around to stop smoking as it is not at all pocket friendly.
  * Women with any number of children have almost same BMI as observed by hypothesis testing, basic awareness around family planning can be provided to keep them from facing financial issues.
  * With increasing age the charges too increase, so we can promote a healthy living in the middle ages to avoid these charges in the later stage of life.
