<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Health insurance is insurance that covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses, spreading the risk over a large number of persons. By estimating the overall risk of health care and health system expenses over the risk pool, an insurer can develop a routine finance structure, such as a monthly premium or payroll tax, to provide the money to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement. The benefit is administered by a central organization such as a government agency, private business, or not-for-profit entity.</p>
<p>According to the Health Insurance Association of America, health insurance is defined as âcoverage that provides for the payments of benefits as a result of sickness or injury. It includes insurance for losses from accident, medical expense, disability, or accidental death and dismembermentâ (p.Â 225).</p>
<p><em>(Source: Wikipedia)</em></p>
<p>Goal of this data processing is to <strong>predict accurately the insurance costs</strong>.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Insurance Member Behaviour</h1>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to get an insight of insurance member behaviour such as: age, sex, region, smoker.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> What Variables Affect The Medical Cost?</h1>
<p>I made this density analysis to find the variables which affect the medical costs. From this analysis (you need to see the density chart), I gain some insights:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Sex is not make an impact to medical costs insurance because male and female has a same distribution/density against charges (look at Chart 4.1).</p></li>
<li><p>Region is not make a big impact to medical costs insurance because 4 regions almost have a same distribution/density against charges (look at Chart 4.2).</p></li>
<li><p>Smoker and non-smoker affect the medical costs insurance because the distribution/density have a big different (look at Chart 4.3).</p></li>
<li><p>Total number of children/dependents have a same density against charges, except zero number of children. So, if youâre not have a child it will cause an effect to medical costs insurance (look at Chart 4.4).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>According to those insights, I can conclude that <strong>Smoke, total dependents, age, and BMI</strong> are the variables to predict the medical costs insurance.</p>

<p>Since smokers, total dependents, and BMI made an effect to medical costs insurance, Iâm grouping those factors into 8 category shown on sub-chapter below. Eventually, I only have age or and BMI as an input variable(s) to my prediction equation. The equation will shown in sub-chapter, so you need to check it.</p>
<p><strong>Cat - 1</strong> : Smoker, have no dependent, BMI under 30.</p>
<p><strong>Cat - 2</strong> : Smoker, have no dependent, BMI over 30.</p>
<p><strong>Cat - 3</strong> : Smoker, have dependents, BMI under 30.</p>
<p><strong>Cat - 4</strong> : Smoker, have dependents, BMI over 30.</p>
<p><strong>Cat - 5</strong> : Non-smoker, have no dependent, BMI under 30.</p>
<p><strong>Cat - 6</strong> : Non-smoker, have no dependent, BMI over 30.</p>
<p><strong>Cat - 7</strong> : Non-smoker, have dependents, BMI under 30.</p>

<p>From those two summary, I decided to use linear regression with 1 variable (age) because it have a better R-Squared value.</p>
<p>So, the equation will be like:</p>
<p><strong>-2161.36 + (282.54 * AGE)</strong></p>

<div id="charges-prediction" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Charges Prediction</h1>
<p>From grouping the equation, I made a function to predict the charges. The function is look like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>predict &lt;- function(x){
               for(i in 1:nrow(x)){
               if(x[i,&quot;smoker&quot;] == &quot;yes&quot; &amp;&amp; x[i,&quot;children&quot;] == 0 &amp;&amp; x[i,&quot;bmi&quot;] &lt; 30){
